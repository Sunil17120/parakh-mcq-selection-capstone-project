"How would you handle a situation where a project's scope is expanding, but the deadline remains the same?",,"I would immediately communicate the issue to my project manager and the stakeholders. I would present a clear case for why the new requirements cannot be met within the current timeline.

The goal is to set realistic expectations and ensure a high-quality product is delivered on time.",0.8,scenario
"Explain the difference between a for loop and a while loop in programming.",,"A for loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want the loop to run. For example, if you want to print a message 10 times, you would use a for loop.

"How would you handle a situation where a client asks for a feature that you believe is not feasible?",,"I would first listen to the client's request to understand their needs. Then, I would explain why the feature is not feasible from a technical standpoint, providing clear and concise reasons. I would then propose a more feasible alternative that still meets their needs. The goal is to work with the client to find a solution that works for everyone.",0.8,scenario
"How do you handle a situation where a team member is not contributing to the project?",,"I would start by having a private conversation with the team member to understand the root cause of the issue. I'd ask if they are facing any personal or professional challenges. I would then work with them to set clear goals and provide the necessary support and resources. If the problem persists, I would escalate the issue to a manager.",0.75,scenario
"How do you deal with a situation where a project you're working on is canceled?",,"I would first try to understand the reasons for the cancellation and what the next steps are. I would then review the project to document any valuable work that could be reused in the future. Finally, I would work with my manager to transition to a new project.",0.65,scenario

I would assign them a mentor and an easy task to get started, ensuring they feel comfortable asking questions and contributing early on.",0.8,scenario
"How do you handle a disagreement with a team member about a technical decision?",,"I would start by listening to their perspective and asking clarifying questions to understand their reasoning. I would then explain my point of view, focusing on the technical pros and cons of each approach rather than personal opinions. If we can't reach a consensus, I would suggest bringing in a third party, like a senior engineer or a tech lead, to provide a fresh perspective and help us make a data-driven decision.",0.85,scenario
"How would you handle a situation where a critical feature is due soon, but you've discovered a major roadblock you didn't foresee?",,"I would first assess the impact of the roadblock on the timeline and the project. I would then communicate the issue to my project manager and team members as soon as possible, providing a clear explanation of the problem, potential solutions, and a revised timeline.

"Explain the concept of an API to a friend who is not a programmer.",,"I would compare an API to a waiter in a restaurant. When you want to order food, you don't go to the kitchen yourself. Instead, you tell the waiter what you want from the menu. The waiter takes your order to the kitchen, and then brings the food back to you. The API is like the waiter: it takes your request, processes it on a server, and returns the information you asked for.",0.85,scenario
"Describe your process for writing a new feature from start to finish.",,"I would start by understanding the requirements and defining the scope of the feature. I'd then break the feature down into smaller tasks and create a plan. After that, I would write the code, ensuring it's well-structured and follows coding standards.
